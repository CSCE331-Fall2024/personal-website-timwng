            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Howdy! I’m a dedicated Computer Science major at <a class="link" href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>
              , with hands-on experience in full-stack development and
              a strong foundation in programming. My recent internship at 4Voice
              allowed me to work on the development of an in-house Laravel
              application, where I enhanced my skills in creating intuitive and
              efficient web solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive in dynamic environments and am always eager to learn new
              technologies and frameworks. Whether it's contributing to a team
              project or diving into personal projects, my goal is to continue
              growing as a developer. I’m excited to explore new opportunities
              and collaborate on innovative projects, bringing a passion for
              problem-solving and a willingness to learn.
            </p>
            <h3>My CS Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              My background in computer science starts from my introduction to Python
              in AP Computer Science Principles and A. From there, I learned 
              simple data structures, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">OOP</a>, problem solving, and many other
              essential skills which have contributed to my current passion for
              computer science. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To build onto my knowledge, I joined my high school computer science
              where I learned competitive programming and the ins and outs of
              high and low level programming languages. I soon became the 
              president of the Cinco Ranch Computer Science Club where I helped
              manage the club's logistics, taught workshops for Java and competitive
              programming, attended UIL CS competitions, and gained experience
              through participating in Hackathons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now at Texas A&M University, I have gained much experience related
              to software development through my coursework, Aggie Coding Club,
              a summer internship, and many personal/group projects which have
              served to add experience to my technical, social, and professional
              skills which are essential for a successful career in CS.
            </p>
            <h3>More about me</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a second generation American-born-Chinese who has 3 dogs that 
              were all strays. I love sports (currently <a class="link" href="https://spikeball.com/" target="_blank">Spikeball</a>, volleyball, table tennis),
              producing music, piano, guitar, singing, spending time with friends, and... CODING!
              Besides my hobbies, I'm a loving guy willing to chat and get to know you, so if
              you ever see me at the library studying, the volleyball courts, or waiting in 
              Panda Express line, feel free to say hi!
