            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              I'm interested in full-stack development and much of my interests are still growing at <br>
              this moment. I find that front-end development is very satisfying and connecting back-end <br>
              to front-end is when an application really starts to take shape. As a result, my interests <br>
              are mostly based on the creation of something new and useful. Software development is the <br>
              field that combines all my interests into one cohesive and brilliant field where I am free <br>
              to experiment, learn, collaborate, and develop new and innovative programs that can bring <br>
              positive change to people's lives. 
            </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Howdy! I’m a dedicated Computer Science major at
              <a
                class="link"
                href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html"
                target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>
              , with hands-on experience in full-stack development and a strong
              foundation in programming. My recent internship at 4Voice allowed
              me to work on the development of an in-house Laravel application,
              where I enhanced my skills in creating intuitive and efficient web
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive in dynamic environments and am always eager to learn new
              technologies and frameworks. Whether it's contributing to a team
              project or diving into personal projects, my goal is to continue
              growing as a developer. I’m excited to explore new opportunities
              and collaborate on innovative projects, bringing a passion for
              problem-solving and a willingness to learn.
            </p>
            <h3>More About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a second generation American-born-Chinese who has 3 dogs that
              were all strays. I love sports (currently
              <a class="link" href="https://spikeball.com/" target="_blank">Spikeball</a>,
              volleyball, table tennis), producing music, piano, guitar,
              singing, spending time with friends, and... CODING! Besides my
              hobbies, I'm a loving guy willing to chat and get to know you, so
              if you ever see me at the library studying, the volleyball courts,
              or waiting in Panda Express line, feel free to say hi!
            </p>
            <h3>My CS Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              My background in computer science starts from my introduction to
              Python in AP Computer Science Principles and A. From there, I
              learned simple data structures,
              <a
                class="link"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"
                target="_blank">OOP</a>, problem solving, and many other essential 
                skills which have contributed to my current passion for computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
              To build onto my knowledge, I joined my high school computer
              science where I learned competitive programming and the ins and
              outs of high and low level programming languages. I soon became
              the president of the Cinco Ranch Computer Science Club where I
              helped manage the club's logistics, taught workshops for Java and
              competitive programming, attended UIL CS competitions, and gained
              experience through participating in Hackathons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now at Texas A&M University, I have gained much experience related
              to software development through my coursework, Aggie Coding Club,
              a summer internship, and many personal/group projects which have
              served to add experience to my technical, social, and professional
              skills which are essential for a successful career in CS.
